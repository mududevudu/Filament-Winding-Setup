## üìñ Abstract

Filament winding is a key manufacturing process for creating lightweight, high-strength, and corrosion-resistant composite materials used in industries like aerospace, automotive, and renewable energy. This project covers the complete design and development of a compact, lab-scale filament winding machine suitable for educational and R&D purposes. The final design integrates mechanical principles with an Arduino-based mechatronic system to achieve automated and precise winding patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design & Methodology

The machine was developed following a systematic engineering design process: understanding the problem, identifying potential solutions, benchmarking against commercial products, detailed design, and finally, manufacturing and testing.

### Mechanical Design
A key design feature is the **linearly moving resin bath**, which travels along a stationary **rotating mandrel**. This approach enhances the precision of the winding pattern. The resin bath contains a series of rods to maintain proper fiber tension and ensure thorough impregnation with the heated epoxy. All parts were modeled in SolidWorks to ensure proper fit and function before manufacturing.

### Electronic Control System
The automation is achieved using a simple yet robust mechatronic system. An **Arduino Uno** acts as the microcontroller, sending signals to an **LN298N Motor Driver** which powers the **Linear Actuator** responsible for the resin bath's precise horizontal movement.
